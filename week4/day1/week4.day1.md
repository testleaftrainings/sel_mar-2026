Polymorphism:
Definition

Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.
It is derived from two Greek words: "poly" and "morphs". "Poly" means many and "morphs" means forms.
Types - compile-time polymorphism - runtime polymorphism. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved by method overloading, while runtime polymorphism is achieved by method overriding. - It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class for seamless interaction, typically through the use of method overriding within an inheritance hierarchy. - This enables Java programs to be written more abstractly, promoting scalability and maintainability.

Overloading: - It refers to the ability to create multiple methods of the same name with different implementations. -Calls to an overloaded method will run a specific implementation of that method appropriate to the context, based on the number and type of arguments passed.

Java Examples:

Methods like add() can be overloaded to accept different types of arguments.
Similarly, substring() in the String class is overloaded to accept different starting and ending points for the substring.
println()
Selenium WebDriver Examples:

The frame() method in Selenium WebDriver is overloaded to allow different types of arguments like an integer (index of the frame), a String (name or ID of the frame), or a WebElement.
Advantages of Overloading:

Flexibility: Allows methods to handle different data types and numbers of arguments.
Readability: It can make the code more readable since the same method name can be used for similar actions on different types of input.
Reduces Complexity: Developers can use the same method name to perform similar actions, which simplifies code organization and maintenance.
Overriding

Method overriding in Java occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass.
It's a key feature of runtime polymorphism and allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already provided by its parent class
Examples:

equals() of String class is overriden from the Object class
toString() of String class is overriden from the Object class
quit() of ChromiumDriver is overriden from the RemoteWebDriver Class


Abstraction:
Definition:

Abstraction is an OOPs concept that focuses on hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts of an object. It's about representing features without including background details.
Advantages of Abstraction:

Simplicity: Abstraction simplifies the view of an object, so you don't need to understand the internal workings to use it.
Reusability: Abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement common methods in multiple subclasses.
Keyword: The implements keyword is used to implement an Interface

Types:

Interfaces: Used for full abstraction, they cannot have any implementation.
Abstract Classes: Provide partial abstraction with some implemented methods.
Concrete Classes: Regular classes with full implementation.
Java Examples:

Interfaces: List, Set, Map are interfaces providing a standard set of methods to be implemented by concrete collections.
Abstract Classes: AbstractList, AbstractCollection provide skeletal implementations that can be used as starting points for creating concrete collections.
Selenium WebDriver Examples:

Interfaces: WebDriver, WebElement, Alert are interfaces representing abstract concepts in browser automation.
Abstract Classes: By is an abstract class providing methods to locate elements.
Concrete Classes: RemoteWebDriver is a concrete implementation of the WebDriver interface.
